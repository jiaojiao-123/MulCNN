# MulCNN
MulCNN(Multiscale Convolutional Neural Networks) provides a deep learning method for cell type identification for scRNA-seq analysis. Using multi-scale convolution while filtering noise, the method extracts key features specific to individual cell types.
The repository contains the source code for the paper MulCNN, a novel neural network framework for single-cell RNA-Seq analysis.
